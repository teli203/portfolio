# jQuery Calculator

## File

* [`jquery-calculator-starter`](Unsolved/jquery-calculator.html)

## Instructions

* Create the JavaScript logic necessary to add functionality to the jQuery Calculator.

* Your calculator should be able to handle basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.

* You should be making use of the existing buttons.

* You should be making use of the existing placeholders for entering content (i.e. "firstNumber", "operator", "secondNumber", "result").

* You should have fun and push yourselves! This is a challenge activityâ€”which means, if you get it done, you are a King of jQuery. If you don't, no sweat. The important thing is that you learned at least a FEW things along the way.

**NOTE #1**: This large activity is broken up into multiple phases, as described in the ["phase-guide.md"](phase-guide.md) file. The timing and pacing are only suggestions on how you should be proceeding and focusing your time. We will be Slacking out the start of each phase (i.e. "Starting phase 2!" around 11:30am), but those are also simply pacing reminders! You do not need to be at the exact same pace!

**NOTE #2**: If you had any issues following along with the "JS Crash Course", please Slack the instructor and/or TA during this activity and we will do a 10 minute 1:1 session to walk you through it
