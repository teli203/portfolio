# jQuery Calculator Phase Guide
## Phase 1: Getting Situated + Pseudocoding Stage
### Suggested Time: 15 minutes
### Estimated Start: 11:50am
### Objectives
 * For the first 15 minutes, your goals should be to:
   * Become familiar with the various elements of the HTML page as it is written now. (Identify the classes and IDs that matter!)
   * Create a general strategy for how you will accomplish the task:
     * How will you capture button clicks?
     * What will you do with the numbers clicked?
     * What will you do when the operator is clicked?
     * How will you differentiate numbers from operators?
     * How will you know the "value" of a number clicked?
     * How will you know when a user is done entering the first number?
     * Etc.
   * Create a few test "on-click" events. These could just trigger Alert messages for now. If you get further along, then have these buttons alert their "value".

## Phase 3: Begin Logic
### Suggested Time: 15 - 20 minutes
### Estimated Start: 12:45am
### Objectives
 * For the next 15-20 minutes, your goals should be to:
   * Begin creating sets of variables that you think you will need. As a few suggestions:
     * `firstNumber`, `secondNumber`, `operator`, `result`
     * Create code that captures the numbers from button clicks, and then displays them on the HTML
     * Create code that captures an operator click, then immediately tells your code to begin recording the second number
       * Example: If a user clicks the "plus" button, you know they are done typing the first number
     * Create code that checks which operator the user has clicked, then saves this operator for later use in a conditional statement.
       * Example: If a user clicks the "plus" button, you know you will need to be adding two numbers. If a user clicks the "minus" button, you will need to be subtracting two numbers. Think: `if`-`else` statements!

## Phase 4: Continue Logic Building
### Suggested Time: 30 minutes
### Estimated Start: 01:00pm
### Objectives
 * Complete the functionality you are missing in your code.
 * Spend a few moments really assessing what you still have to do.
 * Get a TA/Instructor to help you set priorities if you are unsure as to how to proceed.

## Phase 5: Refinement
### Suggested Time: 15 minutes
### Estimated Start: 01:30pm
### Objectives
 * Complete any remaining functionality in your calculator
 * Handle bugs and edge cases
   * Example: What if a user tries to type in more numbers after getting the result? Will that mess up the screen?
 * Create code to "restart" the calculator after a user clicks "clear".
 * **BONUS**: if you're done and looking for a challenge, look into using a `switch` statement when checking which operator the user clicked
